# Rest Day
Welcome to Rest Day, where we’ll give you your ideal workout plan, stress-free. This web application was created using React.js, Node.js, and utilizing two APIs. It was designed in a precise way, with a minimalistic and user-friendly interface, which can be ported into a mobile application in the future using React Native.

<br>
Rest Day was initially inspired by how exercising saved our mental health during COVID-19. <br>

The pandemic has shown a major increase in adults who reported symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia, compared to surveys prior to the pandemic. This is because the pandemic brought a significant shift in society and to everyday life. The sudden shift caused a change to our daily routines as it increased financial pressures, social isolation and lack of exercise. <br>

As restrictions get lifted, people are starting to exercise more, however, many forget to check in with their mental states and unrested body. This increases fatigue, decreases motivation and sleep as it leads to a depletion of muscle recovery which is an important factor in achieving one’s goal. Keeping track of rest is crucial in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. <br>

This project targets both physical and mental health challenges that have occurred in people's lives due to the pandemic. Our goal is to help young adults keep track of their physical and mental health because not only does exercising, with the right amount of rest, help people lose weight and lower the risk of some diseases, it also alleviates the impact of mental stressors such as low self-esteem and social withdrawal. <br>
