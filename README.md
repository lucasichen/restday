# Rest Day
Welcome to Rest Day, where weâ€™ll give you your ideal workout plan, stress-free. This web application was created using React.js, Node.js, and utilizing two APIs. It was designed in a precise way, with a minimalistic and user-friendly interface, which can be ported into a mobile application in the future using React Native.
